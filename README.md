## Deep Learning From Scratch

I started reading about Deep Learning for over a year now through several articles and reserach papers that I came across mainly in LinkedIn, Medium and [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent). 

When I virtually attended the MIT 6.S191 Deep Learning courses during the last few weeks [(Here is a link to the course site)](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), I decided to start to put some structure in my understanding of Neural Networks through this series of articles. 

I will go through the first four courses: 
1.  Introduction to Deep Learning 
2.  Sequence Modeling with Neural Networks 
3.  Deep learning for computer vision - Convolutional Neural Networks 
4.  Deep generative modeling 

For each course, I will outline the main concepts and add more details and interpretations from my previous readings and my background in statistics and machine learning.  

Starting from the second course, I will also add an application on an open-source dataset for each course.

## MIT 6.S191 - Deep Learning - Course notes 

This is a series of personal notes about the MIT 6.S191 Deep Learning courses that I have virtually attended during the last few weeks. 

[Here is a link to the course site](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).

I will go through the first four courses: 
1.  Introduction to Deep Learning 
2.  Sequence Modeling with Neural Networks 
3.  Deep learning for computer vision - Convolutional Neural Networks 
4.  Deep generative modeling 

Starting from the second course, I will add an application on an open-source dataset for each course.

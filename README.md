## MIT 6.S191 - Deep Learning - Course notes 

This is a series of personal notes about the MIT 6.S191 Deep Learning courses that I have virtually attended during the last few weeks. 

[Here is a link to the course site](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).

I will go through the first four courses: 
1.  Introduction to Deep Learning 
2.  Sequence Modeling with Neural Networks 
3.  Deep learning for computer vision - Convolutional Neural Networks 
4.  Deep generative modeling 

Starting from the second course, I will add an application on an open-source dataset for each course. 

# Introduction to Deep Learning 

Traditional machine learning models have always been very powerful to handle structured data and have been widely used by businesses for credit scoring, churn prediction, consumer targeting, and so on. 

The sucess of these model highly depend on the performance of the feature engineering phase: the more we work close to the business to extract relevant knowledge from the structured data, the more powerful the model will be. 

When it comes to unstructured data (images, text, voice, videos), hand engineered features are time consuming, brittle and not scalable in practice. That is why Neural Networks become more and more popular thanks to their ability to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.

Improvements in Hardware (GPUs) and Software (advanced models / research related to AI) also contributed to **deepen the learning** from data using Neural Networks.  


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ZiedHY/ZiedHY.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZiedHY/ZiedHY.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

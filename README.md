## MIT 6.S191 - Deep Learning - Course notes 

This is a series of personal notes about the MIT 6.S191 Deep Learning courses that I have virtually attended during the last few weeks. 

[Here is a link to the course site](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).

I will go through the first four courses: 
1.  Introduction to Deep Learning by Alexander Amini
2.  Sequence Modeling with Neural Networks by Harini Suresh 
3.  Deep learning for computer vision - Convolutional Neural Networks - by Ava Soleimany 
4.  Deep generative modeling by Aaron Courville


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ZiedHY/ZiedHY.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZiedHY/ZiedHY.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
